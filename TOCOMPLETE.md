### First fundamental form

The first fundamental form of a regular surface at a point p is the quadratic form I : T -> R (it computes the norm of the input vector w as dot product).

For now consider x{u} and x{v} the basis spanning the tangent plane. Any vector w in the tangent plane is tangent to a prametrized curve.
